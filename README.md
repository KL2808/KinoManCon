# KinoManCon
This is a school project in the language "c++" its main goal was to improve our "c++" knowledge and lean a new topic by ourselves. I've chosen to enhance and further develop a popular beginners project (cinema seat booking).

It should be possible to create and evaluate cinema halls, films, individual screenings and customers in the system. The different lists should be able to refer to each other similar to a database, for example: screening "xy" in the cinema hall: "cinema hall ID", on seat A3 customer: "customer ID" and film is played: "film ID". The development is done partly in school and partly out of school. In total, the project should take a working time of almost 20 hours, documented and presented.
